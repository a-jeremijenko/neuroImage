Recreation of images from brain data
The notebooks above collate a few different approaches to rebuilding images from brain data. 
1. Directly training an ML model on unprocessed brain-data:Image pairs.
2. Performing dimensionality reduction and then carrying out this objective training. 
3. Training a GAN to search for images which would elicit similar brain responses to the ones seen.
